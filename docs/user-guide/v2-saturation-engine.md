# V2 Saturation Engine (Token-Based Scaling)

The Workload Variant Autoscaler (WVA) is a **global optimizer**: each cycle it builds a
capacity model for your inference workloads and computes how many replicas each one should
have. It does not patch replica counts directly — it emits a target that HPA or KEDA actuate.
This guide explains, at a high level, the **V2 saturation engine**: the terms it uses, the
metrics it reads, the thresholds that govern it, and the algorithm that turns those into replica
targets.

It is aimed at operators tuning and observing WVA. For the full configuration field reference and
the EPP coordination workflow, see
[Saturation Scaling Configuration](../developer-guide/saturation-scaling-config.md); for the
complete metrics catalog see
[Metrics & Health Monitoring](../developer-guide/metrics-health-monitoring.md).

## Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Model** | A served model (a `modelID`, e.g. `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`) in a namespace. The unit WVA makes a scaling decision for. |
| **Variant** | One deployable configuration of a model — a Deployment/LeaderWorkerSet, typically pinned to an accelerator type (and, for disaggregated serving, a role). A model may have several variants (e.g. A100 vs H100, or prefill vs decode). |
| **Replica** | One running pod of a variant. |
| **Role** | For prefill/decode-**disaggregated** serving, a variant serves the `prefill` or `decode` stage; non-disaggregated variants are `both`. |
| **EPP** | *Endpoint Picker* — the request router in the llm-d inference scheduler ([Gateway API Inference Extension](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension)). EPP spreads requests across replicas; WVA decides how many replicas exist. |
| **Capacity / supply** | How much work a replica (or the whole model) can serve, measured in **KV-cache tokens**. |
| **Demand** | How much work the model currently needs to serve, also in KV-cache tokens. |

## Overview

WVA ships two saturation analyzers:

| Aspect | **V1 (percentage-based)** | **V2 (token-based)** |
|---|---|---|
| Reasons in | KV-cache utilization *fractions* per replica | Absolute **KV-cache tokens** (supply vs. demand) |
| Scale-up size | count of replicas that "look saturated" | a division: `ceil(required tokens / per-replica capacity)` |
| Multi-replica jumps | limited | native |
| Heterogeneous accelerators | not modeled | first-class (per-variant capacity) |
| Zero-replica sizing | not supported | supported (capacity derived from deployment args) |
| GPU-constrained fair-share | not supported | supported (with the limiter) |

V2 is the preferred engine going forward (V1 is the legacy path). It builds an explicit capacity
model in units of KV-cache tokens, so a single decision can jump from, say, 2 → 5 replicas, or
size a variant that currently has **zero** replicas.

### Enabling V2

V2 runs when the saturation-scaling ConfigMap's global `default` entry sets:

```yaml
analyzerName: "saturation"     # the empty string "" is the legacy V1 default
```

Engine selection is read from the `default` entry only — it is **global**. Per-model and
per-namespace entries can override *thresholds*, but not which engine runs.

## How it works

Each cycle, for every model, V2 runs four core steps (plus an optional fifth when the GPU
limiter is enabled).

### 1. Per-replica capacity = the tighter of two ceilings

A replica can't serve past whichever wall it hits first — **memory** or **compute** — so its
usable capacity is the **smaller** of two ceilings, both in KV-cache tokens:

- **Memory ceiling** = `KV_token_capacity × kvCacheThreshold`.
  `KV_token_capacity` (= `num_gpu_blocks × block_size`) is the pod's physical KV-cache size,
  read from `vllm:cache_config_info` (or derived from the deployment's engine args when the
  metric is absent). `kvCacheThreshold` (default **0.80**) reserves headroom — only 80% of the
  cache is treated as usable.
- **Compute ceiling** = how many concurrent tokens the GPU can actually *process* before
  scheduling throughput — not memory — becomes the bottleneck (common for long-generation
  workloads). V2 estimates it from live queue behavior when a replica is queue-saturated,
  otherwise from recent history, otherwise from the deployment's batch/sequence limits. *(The
  detailed estimation chain is in the [developer guide](../developer-guide/saturation-scaling-config.md).)*

A variant's per-replica capacity is the **median** of its ready replicas' capacities (median so
one outlier pod doesn't skew it). A variant with no ready replicas borrows capacity derived from
its deployment args or from a compatible sibling variant — this is what lets V2 size a
zero-replica variant.

### 2. Demand — the tokens the model needs to serve

Demand is also in KV-cache tokens and sums three sources:

```
demand = tokens_in_use          (live: kv_cache_usage × capacity)
       + local_queue_tokens     (requests waiting on the pod × avg input tokens)
       + scheduler_queue_tokens  (requests still queued upstream in the EPP flow-control layer,
                                   before they reach any pod)
```

The upstream scheduler-queue term accounts for load that hasn't landed on a pod yet; its
input-token portion is discounted by the observed prefix-cache hit rate when available.

### 3. The scaling signal

V2 aggregates to model level:

- **`TotalSupply`** = Σ (ready replicas × per-replica capacity)
- **`TotalAnticipatedSupply`** = Σ ((ready + **pending**) replicas × per-replica capacity)
- **`TotalDemand`** = the demand above

We want demand to sit at the target utilization of supply — so the supply we *need* is
`demand ÷ scaleUpThreshold` (e.g. at 0.85, demand should be 85% of supply). That gives two
signals:

```
RequiredCapacity  = max(0, TotalDemand / scaleUpThreshold  − TotalAnticipatedSupply)   → scale up
SpareCapacity     = max(0, TotalSupply  − TotalDemand / scaleDownBoundary)             → scale down
```

- **`RequiredCapacity > 0`** → the supply we need exceeds what's already in flight → **scale up**.
  Because *anticipated* supply counts pending replicas, an in-flight scale-up shrinks
  `RequiredCapacity` — this avoids counting the same scale-up twice.
- **`SpareCapacity > 0`** → even after inflating demand to the `scaleDownBoundary`, supply is
  left over → **scale-down is safe**.
- Neither → **no change**. The band between the two thresholds is a stable no-change region;
  note WVA has no time-based stabilization window yet, so keeping the band wide is what reduces
  flapping.

> V2 also reports a model `utilization = TotalDemand / TotalSupply` for observability, but the
> decision is driven by `RequiredCapacity`/`SpareCapacity` above — **not** by comparing that
> ratio to the thresholds. (On V2 the `wva_spare_capacity` metric reports this token surplus;
> see [Metrics](#metrics).)

### 4. Replica target

```
scale-up replicas   = ceil(RequiredCapacity / per_replica_capacity)
scale-down replicas = floor(SpareCapacity   / per_replica_capacity)
```

Scale-down respects each variant's `minReplicas`, removes highest-cost replicas first, and (for
prefill/decode-disaggregated models) keeps the two roles coupled so the model stays functional.

### 5. (Optional) GPU-constrained fair-share

When `enableLimiter: true`, the desired counts are capped by actually-available GPUs, fair-shared
across competing models weighted by each model's `priority`. Without the limiter (the default),
scale-up is unconstrained and the optimizer simply minimizes cost. Priority weighting applies
**only** in limiter mode.

## Thresholds

Set these in the saturation-scaling ConfigMap (see the
[configuration reference](../developer-guide/saturation-scaling-config.md) for structure and
per-model/per-namespace overrides).

| Key | Default | Range | Effect on V2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kvCacheThreshold` | `0.80` | 0–1 | Fraction of physical KV cache treated as usable → sets the **memory ceiling**. Lower = more headroom. **Agree with EPP — [see below](#aligning-thresholds-with-epp).** |
| `queueLengthThreshold` | `5` | ≥ 0 | Local waiting-queue depth at/above which a replica is "queue-saturated," letting its current token load set the **compute ceiling**. **Agree with EPP — [see below](#aligning-thresholds-with-epp).** |
| `scaleUpThreshold` | `0.85` | (0, 1], `> scaleDownBoundary` | Target peak utilization. Drives **`RequiredCapacity`**. Lower = scale up earlier. |
| `scaleDownBoundary` | `0.70` | (0, 1], `< scaleUpThreshold` | Utilization floor for safe scale-down. Drives **`SpareCapacity`**. The gap to `scaleUpThreshold` is the no-change band. |
| `enableLimiter` | `false` | bool | Turns on step 5 (GPU-constrained fair-share). Requires GPU quota configuration. |
| `priority` | `1.0` | ≥ 0 | Relative weight when fair-sharing scarce GPUs (**limiter mode only**). |
| `analyzerName` / `analyzers` | `""` / — | — | Selects V2 (`"saturation"`) and, via the `analyzers` list, per-analyzer scores and threshold overrides. |

> **Not used by V2:** `kvSpareTrigger` and `queueSpareTrigger` are **V1-only** signals. V2 still
> accepts and exports them as config metrics, but its decision does not consult them.

**Tuning guidance**
- Keep `scaleUpThreshold` and `scaleDownBoundary` apart (e.g. 0.85 / 0.70): a narrow gap risks
  flapping, a wide gap makes scaling sluggish.
- Lower `kvCacheThreshold` if you see pressure near the KV-cache limit — and mirror it in EPP.
- Set values globally (`default`) and override per model (`{modelID}#{namespace}`).

### Aligning thresholds with EPP

`kvCacheThreshold` and `queueLengthThreshold` define **what "a saturated endpoint" means**, and
they should be **agreed with EPP** (the request router). EPP and WVA read the **same two
model-server metrics** — `vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc` and `vllm:num_requests_waiting` — but act at
different layers: EPP routes and, under load, queues/sheds requests as endpoints approach
saturation; WVA decides when the pool is saturated and adds replicas. EPP's Saturation Detector
exposes two thresholds that map one-to-one to WVA's:

| EPP (`saturationDetector` / `utilization-detector`) | Default | WVA V2 | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kvCacheUtilThreshold` | `0.8` | `kvCacheThreshold` | `0.80` |
| `queueDepthThreshold` | `5` | `queueLengthThreshold` | `5` |

If the two disagree, routing and scaling fight each other:
- **WVA higher than EPP** → EPP queues requests in flow-control (raising latency, and inflating
  WVA's own `scheduler_queue` demand term) while WVA still sees headroom → scale-up lags.
- **WVA lower than EPP** → WVA scales up while EPP is still comfortably balancing → over-provisioning.

**Guidance:** set WVA's `kvCacheThreshold` = EPP's `kvCacheUtilThreshold` and `queueLengthThreshold`
= EPP's `queueDepthThreshold`, and mirror any change on both sides. This repo configures EPP's
scorers (`queue-scorer`, `kv-cache-utilization-scorer`) in `deploy/lib/epp-flow-control.values.yaml`.

## Metrics

### Input — what V2 reads from your inference engines

Scraped from vLLM and the EPP scheduler. If these are missing or stale, V2 degrades or skips the
model — check the health metrics below.

| Metric | Type | V2 uses it for |
|---|---|---|
| `vllm:cache_config_info` (`num_gpu_blocks`, `block_size`) | info gauge | KV token capacity → **memory ceiling** |
| `vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc` | gauge | live tokens-in-use → **demand** |
| `vllm:num_requests_waiting` | gauge | local queue → **compute-ceiling** trigger + demand |
| `vllm:request_prompt_tokens_sum` / `_count` | histogram | average **input** tokens per request |
| `vllm:request_generation_tokens_sum` / `_count` | histogram | average **output** tokens per request |
| `vllm:prefix_cache_hits` / `vllm:prefix_cache_queries` | counters | prefix-cache hit rate (discounts input-token demand) — *optional* |
| `inference_extension_flow_control_queue_size` / `_bytes` | gauges (EPP) | upstream scheduler-queue demand — *optional* |

Deployment engine args (`--max-num-seqs`, `--gpu-memory-utilization`, `--block-size`,
`--max-model-len`, `--max-num-batched-tokens`, `--num-gpu-blocks-override`, …) are read from the
Deployment/LeaderWorkerSet — **not** Prometheus — and feed the derived-capacity path.

### Output — WVA metrics to observe V2 decisions

| Metric | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `wva_saturation_utilization` | gauge | Utilization = demand / capacity (0–1). |
| `wva_required_capacity` | gauge | > 0 ⇒ scale-up needed; V2 value is the KV-cache **token** deficit (per-role for P/D-disaggregated models). `unit=continuous`. |
| `wva_spare_capacity` | gauge | > 0 ⇒ safe scale-down headroom; V2 value is the KV-cache **token** surplus — the companion to `wva_required_capacity`. |
| `wva_kv_cache_tokens_used` / `_capacity` | gauges | Total KV tokens in use vs. total capacity across replicas. |
| `wva_desired_replicas` / `wva_current_replicas` | gauges | What V2 wants vs. what's running. |
| `wva_desired_ratio` | gauge | desired / current — the value HPA/KEDA actuate on. |
| `wva_replica_scaling_total` | counter | Scale actions, labeled by `direction` and `reason`. |
| `wva_config_info` | gauge | Active `analyzer_name` + feature flags — confirm V2 is selected. |
| `wva_config_optimization_interval_seconds` | gauge | Decision cadence. |
| `wva_models_processed` | gauge | Models handled last cycle. |
| `wva_available_gpus` | gauge | GPUs available (limiter input). |
| `wva_metrics_freshness_status`, `wva_metrics_pods_discovered`, `wva_metrics_collection_errors_total` | gauges / counter | **Input health** — check these first when scaling looks stuck. |

## Operating V2

### Verify V2 is active

Check `wva_config_info` — the active engine appears in the `analyzer_name` label:

```promql
wva_config_info{analyzer_name="saturation"}   # == 1 when V2 is running
```

If it shows a different `analyzer_name` (or the metric is absent), V2 is not selected — confirm
the ConfigMap's `default` entry sets `analyzerName: "saturation"`.

### Why isn't it scaling?

Work down this list:

1. **No inputs.** `wva_metrics_pods_discovered == 0`, or `wva_metrics_freshness_status{status="stale"|"missing"}` — WVA isn't getting fresh metrics. Check pod discovery / scraping.
2. **Collection errors.** `wva_metrics_collection_errors_total` climbing — a query is failing (labeled by `query_type`).
3. **Not saturated.** `wva_saturation_utilization` is below `scaleUpThreshold` and `wva_required_capacity == 0` — expected no-change.
4. **Scale-up already in flight.** Pending replicas count toward *anticipated* supply, so `wva_required_capacity` stays `0` until they become ready.
5. **Capped by GPUs.** With `enableLimiter: true`, `wva_available_gpus` at/near 0 (or namespace quota exhausted) blocks scale-up even when demand warrants it.
6. **Actuation.** `wva_desired_ratio > 1` but replicas don't change → the HPA/KEDA object consuming the signal isn't acting; check the actuator, not WVA.
