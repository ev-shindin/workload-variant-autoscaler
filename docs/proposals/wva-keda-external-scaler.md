# Proposal: WVA as a KEDA External Scaler

> **Status:** Draft for discussion (untracked working doc) · **Date:** 2026-08-04
> **Author:** (WVA maintainers) · **Area:** actuation / autoscaling integration

---

## 1. Summary

Run WVA as a **KEDA external scaler**: WVA implements KEDA's `ExternalScaler` gRPC service, and `ScaledObject`s reference it via an `external` (or `external-push`) trigger. WVA's global optimizer produces the scaling decision; KEDA/HPA carry it out.

The design keeps WVA's decision path unchanged (its own collector + optimizer) and uses KEDA purely for **actuation**, with an opt-in **managed** mode in which WVA additionally owns a ScaledObject's *envelope* (min/max) and *behavior* fields and can perform **urgent GPU reclamation** (lower the ceiling to free GPUs fast) — while an **unmanaged** ScaledObject is scaled by WVA's metric but keeps its externally-configured envelope.

Discovery is **call-driven**: WVA learns which ScaledObjects to act on from the gRPC calls KEDA makes to it — no cluster-wide `list`/`watch` of ScaledObjects.

## 2. Motivation

WVA today emits `wva_desired_replicas` / `wva_desired_ratio` metrics that reach an HPA via `prometheus-adapter` (external-metrics) or a KEDA `prometheus` trigger. Making WVA a first-class **external scaler**:

- Removes the `prometheus-adapter` dependency for the WVA path.
- Gives WVA a **per-object config channel** (`scalerMetadata`) and a **scale-to-zero** signal (`IsActive`) it doesn't get cleanly today.
- Enables an opt-in **managed** mode where WVA can shape the HPA envelope/behavior and react to emergencies (**urgent ceiling** — free GPUs fast) that the steady-state metric path is too slow to handle.

## 3. Goals / Non-goals

**Goals**
- WVA delivers its scaling decision as a KEDA external scaler (metric path).
- Opt-in **managed** ownership of a ScaledObject's `min/maxReplicaCount` and `advanced…behavior`, via **Server-Side Apply (SSA)** field ownership.
- **Urgent ceiling** to free GPUs quickly for reallocation — lower `maxReplicaCount` to bypass HPA's scale-down stabilization.
- **Call-driven** discovery — no cluster-wide ScaledObject informer.

**Non-goals**
- Replacing WVA's collector or optimizer — their ingestion/decision *role* is unchanged (queries are optimized, not replaced — §7.9, §10).
- Taking over KEDA's responsibilities (HPA creation + `ScaledObject.status` remain KEDA's).
- Owning ScaledObjects that don't reference WVA.
- Writing arbitrary status onto ScaledObjects (the protocol has no such field — see §9).

## 4. Background: the KEDA external-scaler contract

WVA implements the `ExternalScaler` gRPC service (`externalscaler.proto`). KEDA calls four RPCs:

| RPC | KEDA asks | WVA returns |
|---|---|---|
| `GetMetricSpec(ScaledObjectRef)` | metric + target for this object | `metricName`, `targetSize` |
| `GetMetrics(GetMetricsRequest)` | current value | `metricValue` |
| `IsActive(ScaledObjectRef)` | active? (scale to/from zero) | bool |
| `StreamIsActive(ScaledObjectRef)` | (push) activation stream | stream of bool |

The **only inbound payload** is:

```proto
message ScaledObjectRef {
  string name = 1;
  string namespace = 2;
  map<string,string> scalerMetadata = 3;   // the trigger's metadata block, verbatim
}
message GetMetricsRequest { ScaledObjectRef scaledObjectRef = 1; string metricName = 2; }
```

KEDA does **not** pass current replicas, pod/vLLM metrics, HPA state, or ScaledObject status. WVA gathers all telemetry itself. KEDA's HPA then computes `desiredReplicas = ceil(metricValue / targetSize)`, **clamped to `[minReplicaCount, maxReplicaCount]`**, subject to `behavior` (stabilization + policies). (Newer KEDA adds float variants `targetSizeFloat`/`metricValueFloat`.)

Trigger example:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: external            # or external-push
    metadata:
      scalerAddress: wva-scaler.wva-system.svc:9090
      inferencePool: my-pool
      modelName: llama-3-70b
      engine: vllm
      scalingPolicy: interactive
      wvaOwnership: "true"     # managed vs unmanaged (see §6); full metadata schema in §7.2
```

## 5. Actuation: three mechanisms, three timescales

Each mechanism writes **different fields**, so they compose with single-writer-per-field semantics. KEDA still owns the HPA and `ScaledObject.status`.

| Concern | Mechanism | Cadence | Fields |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Steady-state count** | External-scaler **metric** → HPA `ceil(value/target)` | per poll (~30s) | none on ScaledObject |
| **Envelope / behavior** (managed only) | **SSA-apply** owned fields | occasional (policy change / drift) | `min/maxReplicaCount`, `advanced…behavior`, `fallback` |
| **Urgent ceiling** (managed only) | Lower the **ceiling** (`maxReplicaCount`), then relax | event | `maxReplicaCount` |

**Steady state.** WVA's optimizer output is encoded as `metricValue`/`targetSize`; HPA computes the count within `[min,max]`. WVA writes nothing on the ScaledObject.

**Envelope/behavior.** In managed mode WVA SSA-applies only the fields it owns (dedicated field manager, e.g. `wva`). This sets the bounds the metric operates within and tunes responsiveness (e.g., short scale-up stabilization for latency-critical targets).

**Urgent ceiling (free GPUs fast).** The urgent lever is the **ceiling**, because HPA's stabilization is asymmetric: scale-up `stabilizationWindowSeconds` defaults to **0** (the metric path already scales *up* fast), but scale-down defaults to **300s** (HPA waits ~5 min before removing replicas). When WVA needs to **reclaim GPUs** — a higher-priority workload is starving under GPU contention, or the quota/fair-share optimizer wants to rebalance — it **lowers `maxReplicaCount`** to force an immediate scale-down that **bypasses the scale-down stabilization window**, freeing GPUs now for reallocation. It then relaxes `max` back up once the metric reflects the new steady state. Two safety properties: (1) lowering `max` cannot push a target below its own `minReplicaCount` (HPA still honors `min`), so min-availability floors stay safe; (2) because WVA's metric already reflects the reduced demand, relaxing `max` does **not** cause a rebound — the ceiling patch merely *accelerates* the drop the metric would eventually produce, never fights it. (Urgent scale-*up* is rarely needed since the metric path is already fast upward; a symmetric floor patch on `minReplicaCount` is available if ever required.)

## 6. Managed vs. unmanaged (the `wvaOwnership` flag)

A per-ScaledObject flag in the trigger `metadata` (delivered as `scalerMetadata`, also readable from the spec):

- **Unmanaged** (`wvaOwnership` absent/false): WVA scales the object **only via the metric**. It **reads** `min/max` + `behavior` and treats them as **hard constraints** (user/GitOps owns them). If WVA's desired count exceeds `max`, it is capped and **reports/logs** rather than overriding.
- **Managed** (`wvaOwnership: "true"`): WVA additionally **owns** `min/max` + `behavior` via SSA, and may **urgent-lower the ceiling** to free GPUs. If desired exceeds `max`, WVA **raises `max`** (it owns it). Managed↔unmanaged transitions are seen on the next call.

### Ownership semantics
- Ownership = **authoritative writer of specific fields** via an SSA **field manager**, *not* `ownerReferences`.
- Do **not** add a controller `ownerReference` to a user-created ScaledObject (it would GC-couple the user's object to WVA's lifecycle). Reserve `ownerReferences` for ScaledObjects WVA **generates** itself.
- KEDA still reconciles the ScaledObject → HPA and owns `.status` regardless.

### GitOps drift
If a managed ScaledObject is Argo/Flux-managed, WVA's SSA writes to `min/max`/`behavior` are drift. Resolve by either: GitOps `ignoreDifferences` on the WVA-owned fields (the SSA field manager makes this precise), **or** have WVA **generate** the ScaledObject so it is the end-to-end source of truth.

## 7. Identity & configuration model

**No `VariantAutoscaling` CRD, no discovery/variant labels, no ScaledObject annotations.** All identity and per-target config flows through the trigger **metadata** (`scalerMetadata`); all scaling *policy* flows through **layered ConfigMaps**; everything else is **inferred** from the workload.

### 7.1 The scale unit: the ScaledObject replaces the "variant"

A ScaledObject has exactly one `scaleTargetRef`, but an **InferencePool spans many Deployments/LWS**. Therefore:

- Deploy **one ScaledObject per Deployment/LWS**. The ScaledObject is the atomic scale unit that **replaces the old "variant"** — WVA's internal identity is `(namespace, ScaledObject)`.
- `inferencePool` in metadata is a **grouping key**, not a single actuation handle. WVA keys its registry by ScaledObject and builds a **secondary index by pool** for pool-level/global reasoning (GPU budget, fair-share). ***N ScaledObjects → 1 pool.***
- The InferencePool is routing; the scale target is the backing Deployment/LWS (`inference_pool_ready_pods` is an *outcome*, not a scale handle).

### 7.2 Trigger metadata (per-target facts)

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: external                       # or external-push
    metadata:
      scalerAddress: wva-scaler.wva-system.svc:9090
      inferencePool: my-pool             # grouping + pool-level EPP signals (name; ns defaults to SO ns)
      modelName: llama-3-70b             # serving-metric key (require >=1 of pool/model; model preferred)
      engine: vllm                       # REQUIRED — drives query templates (vllm|sglang|…)
      cost: "2.5"                         # per-replica cost — naturally per-accelerator (this SO = one accelerator)
      scalingPolicy: interactive         # named, reusable policy (no model_name inside)
      wvaOwnership: "true"               # managed vs unmanaged (see §6)
      # role: NOT set here — inferred from the workload (see §7.4); optional override only
```
`scaleTargetRef` is **not** in metadata — it is the ScaledObject's own spec field, which WVA reads.

### 7.3 Placement principle

> **Metadata = per-*target* facts. ConfigMap = per-*model*/tier policy. Inferred = workload-derivable facts.**

| Attribute | Where | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `inferencePool`, `modelName`, `engine`, `scalingPolicy` ref, `wvaOwnership` | **metadata** | per target |
| `cost` | **metadata** | per target — per-accelerator by construction |
| `role`, accelerator type, GPU/replica | **inferred** from `scaleTargetRef` workload | per target |
| `priority` (tier default), scale thresholds, SLO targets | **named policy CM** | per tier (reusable) |
| `enableLimiter`, `enableRescale`, GPU budget, fallbacks | **default/namespace CM** | cluster / tenant |

- **Role** is inferred from the workload: primary = engine args (`--disaggregation-mode prefill|decode`, parsed by `deployment_parser`); fallback = pod-template label `llm-d.ai/role`. Optional metadata override only for ambiguous `both`.
- **Accelerator type / GPU count** from the `scaleTargetRef` pods' resource requests + node GPU type (existing discovery). **Cost** stays in metadata (per-accelerator); a future iteration can source it from OpenCost without changing shape.

### 7.4 Metric attribution without a variant label

`vllm:`/`sglang:` metrics are keyed by **`model_name` only** — no pool/variant/per-deployment label. If two Deployments in a pool serve the *same* model, their series are indistinguishable by label. Since the design forbids labels, attribution is **topological, not label-based**:

- Query serving metrics by `model_name` (grouped by `pod`), then **map each `pod` → its `scaleTargetRef` via ownerReferences** — the existing **Locator** (`pod-to-managed-scaler-locator`). No variant label needed.
- WVA already **GETs the ScaledObject** (for `min/max/behavior`); the same GET yields `scaleTargetRef`, whose pods define the attribution set.
- **Heterogeneous engines** in a pool are handled because `engine` is per-ScaledObject (each Deployment runs one engine); pool-level EPP metrics are engine-agnostic.

### 7.5 Layered configuration & reusable policies

Policies are **identity-free** (no `model_name`) — a named policy is a reusable **scaling tier** (`interactive`, `standard`, `batch`) referenced by many models. Resolution reuses the existing `Merge()` (scalar override), applied across layers, most-specific wins:

```
SO metadata            (per-target: cost, engine, pool, ownership, optional priority override)
  ▼ overrides
named ScalingPolicy    (per-tier: thresholds, default priority, analyzer selection)   ← metadata.scalingPolicy
  ▼ overrides
namespace default CM   (per-tenant: budget/quota, rescale/limiter, defaults)           [optional, add later]
  ▼ overrides
global default CM      (cluster: fallback thresholds, GPU budget, defaultPolicy)
```

- **Priority** = tier default in the policy + **optional per-SO metadata override** (metadata > policy). Priority tracks the tier, so sharing across a tier's models is correct.
- **Budget-scope knobs** (`enableLimiter`, `enableRescale`, GPU budget) live in the **default/namespace layer**, not the reusable policy — they are cluster/namespace-scoped (the code already reads `EnableRescale` "only from the default entry"; this formalizes it).
- **Emit the resolved effective policy** per SO (`wva_effective_policy_*` metric / structured log) — layered config is hard to debug without a "which value won" readout; annotations are disallowed, so use a metric/log.
- **Start with two layers** (global default + named policy); add the namespace layer only when multi-tenancy demands it.

### 7.6 Analyzers: a cluster catalog, selected by policy

WVA has **two kinds of analyzers that share one output contract**, so a policy selects and weights them uniformly:

- **Internal analyzers** — compiled-in **Go** (the saturation-v2 token/capacity model, rate-anchored k2, queueing-model, throughput). Rich logic that is *not* expressible as a single PromQL (engine-arg parsing, capacity store, rate anchoring). Referenced by name; built-in, **not** defined in a ConfigMap.
- **External analyzers** — config-driven **PromQL** per **PR #1444** (follow-up **#1455**): each defines a **`query`** (the Demand `D`) and a per-replica **`threshold`** — a constant, or a `thresholdQuery` for measured capacity (the Target `P`). Added in the catalog CM **with no code change**.

**The shared contract is `D/P`.** Every analyzer — internal or external — yields a Demand and a per-replica Target; `D/P` is a replica count. This is the unifier: it's the collector query pair, the composite-scoring input, *and* the external-scaler metric (`Demand → metricValue`, `Target → targetSize`, HPA computes `ceil(D/P)`).

**Policies select/weight; they don't define.** Levels:

| Level | Owns | Reusable across |
|---|---|---|
| **Built-in registry** (Go) | *internal* analyzer implementations, by name | — |
| **Analyzer catalog** (cluster CM `wva-analyzers`) | *external* analyzer definitions: `name → {query, threshold\|thresholdQuery, activationThreshold, metricType, role, engines}` | all models & tiers |
| **Named policy** (tier CM) | *selection + weighting* of internal **and** external by name: `[{name, enabled, score, per-analyzer thresholds}]` | models in a tier |
| **ScaledObject metadata** | identity + per-target facts | one target |

**Name resolution:** a policy entry's `name` resolves against the **built-in registry first (internal), then the catalog (external)**; an optional `source: internal|external` disambiguates/validates. So `saturation` (internal Go) and `ttft-slo` (external PromQL) sit side by side in the same policy, combined by the same composite score.

**External analyzers use KEDA scaler field names directly** — an external analyzer *is* essentially a KEDA `prometheus` trigger, so a KEDA user reads it with no translation. The fields:

- **`query`** — PromQL for the current (total) signal (the Demand).
- **`threshold`** — per-replica target as a **constant** (the common case, e.g. `threshold: "0.5"`), *or* **`thresholdQuery`** — a PromQL when per-replica capacity must be measured.
- **`activationThreshold`** — scale-to/from-zero gate.
- **`metricType`** — `AverageValue` (default): HPA scales relative to replica count.

Desired replicas = `ceil(query / threshold)`, so a static per-replica target needs **no query at all**. (Internal Go analyzers compute the per-replica target in code — e.g. saturation's token capacity — the dynamic case; external analyzers cover both constant and measured targets without code.) *Impl note for #1455:* pin the HPA `metricType` (AverageValue divides the metric by replica count) so the `query/threshold` arithmetic is exact.

The catalog **merges with the collector query registry** — the Go-registered templates (`saturation.go`, `rate_capacity.go`, …) become the built-in default catalog, extensible via config with no code change. The same collector optimizations apply: write catalog queries with a `{{scope}}` placeholder expanding to `model_name=~"…"` + grouped `by (…)` (one query across all managed models), and precompute heavy expressions as **recording rules**.

**Backend = query variant, not a separate analyzer.** An analyzer is a *concept* (saturation, ttft-slo); vLLM vs SGLang (vs future engines) are per-engine query **bodies** of that concept, selected by the SO's `engine`. This keeps policies backend-agnostic — a policy enables `saturation`, never `saturation-vllm` — and mirrors the existing `registerForEngine` pattern (same logical query, per-engine template). It also keeps a **mixed-engine pool comparable**: every target's `saturation` means the same thing regardless of engine, so pool fair-share compares like with like. Engine-*agnostic* analyzers (built on EPP/GIE metrics like `inference_pool_*` / `inference_objective_*`) use a single body with no `engines:` map; if a SO's engine has no body for an engine-specific analyzer, that analyzer is skipped for it (logged). The output metric stays labeled by the analyzer *concept* (`wva_analyzer_demand{analyzer, namespace, model, role?}`) — an `engine` label is optional for observability only, not a new analyzer identity.

**Examples**

```yaml
# ConfigMap: wva-analyzers   (cluster — EXTERNAL analyzer DEFINITIONS only; internal ones are built-in Go)
# Fields mirror KEDA scaler vocabulary: query (=Demand D), threshold / thresholdQuery (=per-replica Target P),
# activationThreshold, metricType. {{scope}}=model/ns selector, {{group}}=group-by set, {{pool}}=pool name.
# An analyzer is a CONCEPT; backend = per-engine query VARIANT selected by the SO's `engine`.
analyzers:
  ttft-slo:                  # per-replica target is a CONSTANT (KEDA `threshold`) — no target query needed
    role: fromPod            # llm-d.ai/role pod-template label (NOT a metric label)
    metricType: AverageValue
    activationThreshold: "0"
    engines:
      vllm:
        query: sum by ({{group}}) (max_over_time(vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_sum{ {{scope}} }[1m]))
        threshold: "0.5"     # per-replica TTFT-SLO target (seconds)
      sglang:
        query: sum by ({{group}}) (max_over_time(sglang:time_to_first_token_seconds_sum{ {{scope}} }[1m]))
        threshold: "0.5"
  pool-queue:                # engine-AGNOSTIC; per-replica target MEASURED via a query (thresholdQuery)
    query:          sum by ({{group}}) (max_over_time(inference_pool_average_queue_size{name="{{pool}}"}[1m]))
    thresholdQuery: avg by ({{group}}, pod) (<per-replica queue capacity>)
```
```yaml
# ConfigMap: wva-policy-interactive   (TIER — selection + weights; identity-free, no model_name)
scaleUpThreshold: 0.85     # WVA composite no-change band (not a KEDA field)
scaleDownBoundary: 0.70
priority: 10
analyzers:
  - name: saturation       # INTERNAL (built-in Go token/capacity analyzer)
    enabled: true
    score: 1.0
  - name: ttft-slo         # EXTERNAL (PromQL, defined in the wva-analyzers catalog)
    enabled: true
    score: 0.5
    threshold: "0.4"        # KEDA-compatible per-analyzer override (tighter TTFT for interactive)
```
```yaml
# ConfigMap: wva-defaults   (GLOBAL default + budget scope)
enableLimiter: true
enableRescale: true
gpuBudget: 128
defaultPolicy: standard      # used when a SO names no policy
scaleUpThreshold: 0.85       # fallback if a policy omits it
scaleDownBoundary: 0.70
```

**Composition caveat:** with multiple analyzers, **compose them inside WVA** (weighted/composite `score` → one `D/P` per ScaledObject) and return a **single** scaler metric. Do **not** map each analyzer to a separate KEDA trigger — HPA takes the *max* across triggers, which is not the weighted composite. Keep #1444's guards: `P ≤ 0` divide-by-zero, `orZero`, bare selectors + `{{scope}}` for arbitrary expressions.

### 7.7 Simplified policy schema (vs. current `SaturationScalingConfig`)

Prune the schema, keep the plumbing (`Merge()` / `ApplyDefaults()` / `Validate()` are reused as the layering + defaults + validation primitives):

- **Delete** `ModelID`, `Namespace` — identity moves to metadata.
- **Move** `EnableLimiter`, `EnableRescale`, GPU budget → the default/namespace layer (budget scope, not per-tier policy).
- **Drop** V1 thresholds (`KvCacheThreshold`, `QueueLengthThreshold`, `KvSpareTrigger`, `QueueSpareTrigger`) and the `AnalyzerName`-vs-`Analyzers` duality **if V2-only**; else isolate behind a legacy struct.
- **Keep** `priority` (tier default), the composite no-change band `scaleUpThreshold` / `scaleDownBoundary` (WVA-specific — no KEDA equivalent), and `analyzers` — each entry `{name, enabled, score}` plus **KEDA-compatible per-analyzer overrides** `threshold` / `activationThreshold`; `name` now points at a catalog (external) or built-in (internal) analyzer.

### 7.8 Worked example: an interactive pool (prefill + decode, vLLM)

One InferencePool `chat-pool` serving `llama-3-70b`, disaggregated into two Deployments — `chat-prefill` and `chat-decode` — both vLLM. This shows *N ScaledObjects → 1 pool*, role inference, and a policy mixing an **internal** and an **external** analyzer.

```yaml
# ── Two ScaledObjects, one per Deployment/LWS (the pool is a grouping key, not a scale handle) ──
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata: { name: chat-prefill, namespace: chat }
spec:
  scaleTargetRef: { name: chat-prefill }        # the Deployment WVA scales (from SPEC, not metadata)
  minReplicaCount: 1
  maxReplicaCount: 8
  triggers:
    - type: external
      metadata:
        scalerAddress: wva-scaler.wva-system.svc:9090
        inferencePool: chat-pool
        modelName: llama-3-70b
        engine: vllm                             # selects vLLM query bodies
        cost: "2.5"                              # per-replica (H100) → per-accelerator by construction
        scalingPolicy: interactive
        wvaOwnership: "true"
        # role NOT set → inferred = prefill (from `--disaggregation-mode prefill`)
---
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata: { name: chat-decode, namespace: chat }
spec:
  scaleTargetRef: { name: chat-decode }
  minReplicaCount: 2
  maxReplicaCount: 16
  triggers:
    - type: external
      metadata:
        scalerAddress: wva-scaler.wva-system.svc:9090
        inferencePool: chat-pool
        modelName: llama-3-70b
        engine: vllm
        cost: "2.5"
        scalingPolicy: interactive
        wvaOwnership: "true"
        # role inferred = decode
```

Both reference the **same reusable `interactive` policy** (§7.6 examples), which selects the **internal** `saturation` analyzer + the **external** `ttft-slo` analyzer; the catalog defines only the external one; `wva-defaults` supplies budget scope + fallbacks.

**Flow per cycle:**
1. KEDA calls the scaler for each SO → WVA registers `{chat/chat-prefill, chat/chat-decode}` in its TTL registry, both indexed under pool `chat-pool`.
2. WVA `GET`s each ScaledObject → `scaleTargetRef`, `min/max`, `behavior`; resolves its pods via ownerReferences (**Locator**); infers `role` from engine args.
3. Collector runs **internal `saturation`** (Go token/capacity model) and **external `ttft-slo`** (PromQL, vLLM body) over `llama-3-70b` metrics, attributed to each SO's pods.
4. Composite score (`interactive`: `saturation` 1.0, `ttft-slo` 0.5) → one `D/P` per SO.
5. Scaler returns `metricValue=D`, `targetSize=P`; each HPA scales its Deployment within `[min,max]`.
6. Under GPU contention, `enableRescale`/`enableLimiter` (from `wva-defaults`, priority-weighted) reallocate; an **urgent ceiling** lowers `maxReplicaCount` on a lower-priority pool to free GPUs immediately (§5).

### 7.9 Collector: efficient shared queries

Analyzer queries **are** the collector queries (§7.6), so optimizing them *is* optimizing the collector. The direction is **stay on Prometheus, improve the PromQL** — not replace the collector (KEDA can't be it, §12).

**Where it stands.** WVA's queries already aggregate across pods in one PromQL per signal — e.g. `max by (instance, pod)(max_over_time(vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc{…}[1m]))` — i.e. the KEDA-style "query the aggregator, don't scrape pods" is already there. But today each template bakes `model_name="{{.modelID}}"`, so a query fires **once per managed model** → `O(queries × models)` per cycle.

**Win #1 — one query across all managed models (`O(queries)`).** Drop the single-model filter; select the managed set with a regex (or fetch-all + filter in Go); add `model_name`/`namespace` to the group-by; fan out by `(namespace, model_name)` in Go. This is exactly what the catalog's `{{scope}}` / `{{group}}` placeholders expand to:

```promql
# per-model (today, ×M):
max by (instance, pod)         (max_over_time(vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc{namespace="ns1",model_name="A"}[1m]))
# collapsed (once):
max by (namespace, model_name, instance, pod)
                               (max_over_time(vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc{namespace=~"ns1|ns2",model_name=~"A|B|C"}[1m]))
```
Note the group-by drops `llm_d_ai_variant` (variant is gone, §7.1) and keeps `pod` — pods are attributed to their ScaledObject via the **Locator** (ownerReferences, §7.4), not a label.

**Win #2 — recording rules.** Push the heavy expressions (rates, `max_over_time`, histogram averages) into Prometheus recording rules; WVA reads a cheap precomputed series:
```yaml
- record: wva:kv_usage:max_by_pod
  expr: max by (namespace, model_name, instance, pod) (max_over_time(vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc[1m]))
```
Per-cycle Prometheus cost then stays small and flat regardless of fleet size. (Trade-off: ships Prometheus rules + inherits the eval-interval delay.)

**Win #3 — dedup & cache.** Fetch each raw metric **once** (e.g. `vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc` is consumed by several analyzers) and share it; give static/info metrics (`vllm:cache_config_info`) a **long cache TTL** rather than re-querying every cycle. WVA's source registry already caches — just tier the TTLs (seconds for load, minutes+ for config).

**Label-surface constraints (§7.4, and the label-surface reference).** `vllm:`/`sglang:` metrics are keyed by `model_name` only (no pool/variant label), so serving analyzers key on `model_name` + Locator attribution — you *cannot* re-key them on the pool. Engine-agnostic analyzers may use EPP `inference_pool_*` (keyed by pool `name`, **no namespace** — GIE #2309, watch cross-namespace collisions).

**Scale lever (optional).** If query volume/cardinality outgrows a single Prometheus, swap in a Prometheus-compatible store (**VictoriaMetrics** single-node) with no query changes; or read pre-aggregated pool signals from **EPP** directly. These are drop-in, not part of the core proposal.

## 8. Discovery: call-driven, no cluster watch

- The gRPC call **is** the registration. KEDA only calls WVA for ScaledObjects whose trigger targets WVA; each call self-registers that object (`name`, `namespace`, `scalerMetadata`). Objects that don't reference WVA are never seen.
- WVA keeps an **in-memory registry** `{ns/name → scalerMetadata, cached min/max/behavior, last-seen}`.
- **No `list`/`watch`.** RBAC is `get`/`patch` on ScaledObjects **by name** only.
- **TTL / age-out.** Without a watch there are no delete events; entries are dropped after several missed poll intervals. This is safe because WVA sets **no `ownerReferences`/finalizers** on user objects — nothing to clean up when an object disappears.

### Reads: cached bounds + behavior (decision inputs)
WVA needs current `min/max` + `behavior` to decide (predict clamping, respect per-target `max` in global fair-share, place the urgent ceiling, judge whether the metric path is fast enough). So each registry entry is **enriched by a targeted `GET`** of that one ScaledObject, cached, refreshed on-call or on a TTL. Reads are **per-object on the called set** — still no informer.

- **Writes are blind SSA** (declarative; no read-then-diff needed).
- **Reads are for decisions:** in unmanaged mode they are *constraints*; in managed mode they are WVA's own values (read mainly to detect drift/SSA conflicts).

### Global-optimizer completeness
WVA's cross-model cost/quota/fair-share needs the full managed set, which holds because:
1. The registry **converges within one KEDA `pollingInterval`** (KEDA calls every trigger).
2. WVA's **telemetry/workload discovery (collector)** is a *separate plane* from the ScaledObject registry — global optimization keys off telemetry WVA already scrapes; the registry only says *where to deliver* each decision.

## 9. What WVA cannot do through this contract

- **Push status onto the ScaledObject:** the protocol has no status field. KEDA reflects scaler *behavior* into `ScaledObject.status` (`Active`/`Ready`/`Fallback` conditions, `health` failure counts, events), but WVA cannot author it. WVA surfaces its own decisions via its existing `wva_*` metrics / CR-status / events.
- **Receive metrics from KEDA:** the channel is one-way (WVA → KEDA). WVA can *read back* KEDA's `keda_scaler_metrics_value` or the external-metrics API, but that is a re-export of upstream signals WVA already reads directly — not useful as an input.
- **Reuse KEDA as a collector:** KEDA scalers are single-query threshold checks wired into KEDA's own loop, not a general telemetry API. WVA keeps its own collector (multi-source, per-model/role aggregation, engine-arg parsing).

## 10. Relationship to WVA's existing components

- **Collector / optimizer:** decision-making stays in WVA (reads Prometheus/EPP directly) — *not* replaced by KEDA (§12). The collector's **queries are optimized** (§7.9): one grouped query across all managed models instead of per-model, optional recording rules, and dedup/caching. Its ingestion *role* is unchanged; its query *shape* improves.
- **`ScaledObjectReconciler`:** today it discovers/reads managed objects (annotation `llm-d.ai/managed`). This proposal narrows it to **call-driven** interaction and adds **conditional SSA ownership** + the **urgent-ceiling** path.
- **Actuator:** the external-scaler gRPC server is a new delivery surface alongside (or replacing) the metric-emission path.

## 11. RBAC

- ScaledObjects: `get`, `patch` (SSA) — **no `list`/`watch`**.
- HPA (optional, for status/current-replicas): `get`.
- gRPC service exposed for KEDA to reach (Service + NetworkPolicy).

## 12. Alternatives considered

1. **KEDA `prometheus` trigger on `wva_desired_replicas`** (reuses KEDA's Prometheus read; drops `prometheus-adapter`). Simpler, but no `scalerMetadata` channel, no `IsActive` ownership hook, and no clean place for managed/urgent. Good default for pure metric delivery; this proposal is the superset.
2. **`prometheus-adapter` → HPA external metrics** (status quo). Extra component; no scale-to-zero; no managed mode.
3. **WVA patches the Deployment scale subresource directly** (bypassing HPA/KEDA). Fights HPA; loses stabilization/behavior; rejected except for scale-from-zero edge cases already handled by the direct actuator.
4. **KEDA as WVA's collector / metrics source** (reuse KEDA scalers to gather telemetry, WVA reads `keda_scaler_metrics_value` or `external.metrics.k8s.io`). **Rejected — structurally unsupported.** KEDA has **no metrics-only mode as of 2026 (v2.20)**: `scaleTargetRef` is mandatory (the direct ask, discussion #2762, is rejected by-design; #1281 only produced OTel observability push-metrics; #470 — single external-metrics adapter per cluster — is a standing blocker, open Oct 2025). The only path is a dummy-Deployment + `autoscaling.keda.sh/paused` hack read via the external-metrics API — fragile, object-sprawling, and scalar-per-trigger (unfit for WVA's joined per-model/role telemetry). WVA keeps its own collector; KEDA is actuation-only.

## 13. Risks / open questions

- **Two write paths:** ensure the metric and any spec patches never both drive the *count* — the metric drives the count *within* WVA-owned `[min,max]`; urgent only lowers the ceiling. Keep the metric consistent with the urgent ceiling so relaxing `max` doesn't cause a rebound. Note the actuated scale-down terminates replicas (in-flight requests) — rely on graceful termination / PodDisruptionBudgets.
- **KEDA validating webhook** may reject some spec changes (e.g., conflicting `scaleTargetRef`) — confirm the owned-field set is webhook-safe.
- **Poll cadence vs urgency:** urgent override mitigates KEDA `pollingInterval` lag, but an object WVA has *never been called about* cannot be urgent-rescaled (acceptable — it isn't wired to WVA).
- **Registry TTL tuning:** age-out threshold vs KEDA `pollingInterval`; avoid dropping live entries.
- **Float vs int metric** across KEDA versions (`metricValueFloat`).
- **Confirm exact `externalscaler.proto` fields and `keda_scaler_metrics_value` labels** against the target KEDA version before implementation.
